***************** Algorithm to find Mean and Standard deviation *****************

Student_marks is an array of student marks
student_count = Student_marks.length
total=0

for each value in Student_marks
   total = total +value
 
mean = total/student_count 

for each value in Student_marks
   sd = sd + pow(value-mean, 2)
  
sd_result = sqrt(sd/student_count);
 

print "Mean of Marks: " mean
print "Standard Deviation: " sd_result
