***************** Algorithm to find highest and Lowest marks *****************

Student_marks is an array of student marks
student_count = Student_marks.length
max <- Student_marks [0]
min <- Student_marks [0]

for each value in Student_marks
    if value > max
        max = value
    else if value < min
        min = value

print "Highest Mark: " min
print "Lowest Mark: " max
